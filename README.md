# ACEs, Identity, and Morality (AIM) Study

## Study Objectives
The purpose of this research study is to understand how adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) inform a person’s moral beliefs. Specifically, we think that some ACEs may contribute to the types of moral beliefs people develop (e.g., whether moral beliefs are more objective, i.e., based in a sense of “right” and “wrong”). We also wonder if one way ACEs influence beliefs is by changing how we come to feel empathy for others and whether aspects of people’s background, identity, and COVID-19 experiences influence links among ACEs, empathy, moral beliefs, and health.
